# NumberGenerator
It's the project built on react native. The application is a part of a project on which Quantum Random Number Generation app is running. 
Reach me at schoud2@stevens.edu, and I would be happy to help.
Remember to look for package.json to install required packages.
You can install the project through running, 
1.)  npm install
then once you see the android and ios folder or all the node modules in your project directory do
2.)  react-native start
then
3.) running the react-native run-android or react-native run-ios based on your system
